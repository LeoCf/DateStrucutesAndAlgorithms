//Tree Lesson 89

//BST

Can perform insertions,deletions and retrieval in O(logn) time
The left child always has a smaller value than its parent
the right child always has a larger value than its parent

So to the left always smaller than parent everything to the right is bigger

Types of traversal

level -> visit nodes on each level;
Pre-Order -> visit the root of every subtree first
Post-order -> visit the root of every subtree last
In-order -> visit left child, then root, then right child.
